# Semi-official Apache CouchDB Docker images [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apache/couchdb-docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apache/couchdb-docker)

Put the couch in a docker container and ship it anywhere.

If you're looking for a CouchDB with SSL support you can check out [klaemo/couchdb-ssl](https://index.docker.io/u/klaemo/couchdb-ssl/)

- Version (stable): `CouchDB 1.7.1`, `Erlang 17.3`
- Version (stable): `CouchDB 2.1.1`, `Erlang 17.3`

## Available tags

- `1.7.1`: CouchDB 1.7.1
- `1.7.1-couchperuser`: CouchDB 1.7.1 with couchperuser plugin
- `latest`, `2.1.1`: CouchDB 2.1.1 single node (capable of running in a cluster)

## Features

* built on top of the solid and small `debian:jessie` base image
* exposes CouchDB on port `5984` of the container
* runs everything as user `couchdb` (security ftw!)
* docker volume for data

## Run (latest/2.1.1)

Available on the docker registry as [apache/couchdb:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/couchdb/).
This is a build of the CouchDB 2.1 release. 

By default, CouchDB's HTTP interface is exposed on port `5984`. Once running, you can visit the new admin interface at `http://<dockerhost>:5984/_utils/`

CouchDB uses `/opt/couchdb/data` to store its data, and is exposed as a volume.

Here is an example launch line for a single-node CouchDB with an admin username and password of `admin` and `password`, exposed to the world on port `5984`:

```bash
$ docker run -p 5984:5984 --volume ~/data:/opt/couchdb/data --volume ~/etc/local.d:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d --env COUCHDB_USER=admin --env COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password apache/couchdb:2.1.1
18:54:48.780 [info] Application lager started on node nonode@nohost
18:54:48.780 [info] Application couch_log_lager started on node nonode@nohost
18:54:48.780 [info] Application couch_mrview started on node nonode@nohost
18:54:48.780 [info] Application couch_plugins started on node nonode@nohost
```

### Detailed configuration (latest/2.x)

CouchDB uses `/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d` to store its configuration. It is highly recommended to bind map this to an external directory, to persist the configuration across restarts.

CouchDB also uses `/opt/couchdb/etc/vm.args` to store Erlang runtime-specific changes. Changing these values is less common. If you need to change the epmd port, for instance, you will want to bind mount this file as well. (Note: files cannot be bind-mounted on Windows hosts.)

In addition, a few environment variables are provided to set very common parameters:

* `COUCHDB_USER` and `COUCHDB_PASSWORD` will create an ini-file based local admin user with the given username and password in the file `/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d/docker.ini`.
* `COUCHDB_SECRET` will set the CouchDB shared cluster secret value, in the file `/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d/docker.ini`.
* `NODENAME` will set the name of the CouchDB node inside the container to `couchdb@${NODENAME}`, in the file `/opt/couchdb/etc/vm.args`. This is used for clustering purposes and can be ignored for single-node setups.

If other configuration settings are desired, externally mount `/opt/couchdb/etc` and provide `.ini` configuration files under the `/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d` directory.

### Important notes (latest/2.x)

Please note that CouchDB no longer autocreates system databases for you. This is intentional; multi-node CouchDB deployments must be joined into a cluster before creating these databases.

You must create `_global_changes`, `_metadata`, `_replicator` and `_users` after the cluster has been fully configured. (The Fauxton UI has a "Setup" wizard that does this for you.)

The node will also start in [admin party mode](http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/security.html#party)!

Note also that port 5986 is not exposed, as this can present *significant* security risks. We recommend either connecting to the node directly to access this port, via `docker exec -it <instance> /bin/bash` and accessing port 5986, or use of `--expose 5986` when launching the container, but **ONLY** if you do not expose this port publicly. Port 5986 is scheduled to be removed with the 3.x release series.

## Run (1.7.1)

Available as an official image on Docker Hub as [apache/couchdb:1.7.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/couchdb/)

```bash
[sudo] docker pull apache/couchdb:1.7.1

# expose it to the world on port 5984
[sudo] docker run -d -p 5984:5984 --name couchdb apache/couchdb:1.7.1

curl http://localhost:5984
```

...or with mounted volume for the data

```bash
# expose it to the world on port 5984 and use your current directory as the CouchDB Database directory
[sudo] docker run -d -p 5984:5984 -v $(pwd):/usr/local/var/lib/couchdb --name couchdb apache/couchdb:1.7.1
```

If you want to provide your own config, you can either mount a directory at `/usr/local/etc/couchdb`
or extend the image and `COPY` your `config.ini` (see [Build you own](#build-your-own)).

If you need (or want) to run couchdb in `net=host` mode, you can customize the port and bind address using environment variables:

 - `COUCHDB_HTTP_BIND_ADDRESS` (default: `0.0.0.0`)
 - `COUCHDB_HTTP_PORT` (default: `5984`)

### 1.7.1 with couchperuser plugin

This build includes the `couchperuser` plugin.
`couchperuser` is a CouchDB plugin daemon that creates per-user databases [github.com/etrepum/couchperuser](https://github.com/etrepum/couchperuser).

```
[sudo] docker run -d -p 5984:5984 --name couchdb apache/couchdb:1.7.1-couchperuser
```

## Development images

This repository provides definitions to run the very latest (`master` branch)
CouchDB code:

* `dev` runs a single node off of the `master` branch, similar to the other
  officially released images.
* `dev-cluster` demonstrates the CouchDB clustering features by creating a
  local cluster of a default three nodes inside the container, with a proxy in
  front.  This is great for testing clustering in your local environment.

You will need to build Docker images from the `dev` directory in this
repository; [Apache Software Foundation policy][4] prevents us from publishing
non-release builds for wide distribution.

When launching the `dev-cluster` container, here is what you will see:

```bash
# expose the cluster to the world
$ docker run -it -p 5984:5984 <image-hash>

[ * ] Setup environment ... ok
[ * ] Ensure CouchDB is built ... ok
[ * ] Prepare configuration files ... ok
[ * ] Start node node1 ... ok
[ * ] Start node node2 ... ok
[ * ] Start node node3 ... ok
[ * ] Check node at http://127.0.0.1:15984/ ... ok
[ * ] Check node at http://127.0.0.1:25984/ ... ok
[ * ] Check node at http://127.0.0.1:35984/ ... ok
[ * ] Running cluster setup ... ok
[ * ] Developers cluster is set up at http://127.0.0.1:15984.
Admin username: root
Password: 37l7YDQJ
Time to hack! ...
```
**Note:** By default the cluster will be exposed on port `5984`, because it uses haproxy (passes `--with-haproxy` to `dev/run`) internally.

You can pass arguments to the binary:

```bash
docker run -it <image-hash> --admin=foo:bar
```

**Note:** This will overwrite the default `--with-haproxy` flag. The cluster **won't** be exposed on
port `5984` anymore. The individual nodes listen on `15984`, `25984`, ...`x5984`. If you wish to expose
the cluster on `5984`, pass `--with-haproxy` explicitly.

More examples:
```bash
# display the available options of the couchdb startup script
docker run --rm <image-hash> --help

# Enable admin party and expose the cluster on port 5984
docker run -it -p 5984:5984 <image-hash> --with-admin-party-please --with-haproxy

# Start two nodes (without proxy) exposed on port 15984 and 25984
docker run -it -p 15984:15984 -p 25984:25984 <image-hash> -n 2
```

## Build your own

You can use `apache/couchdb` as the base image for your own couchdb instance.
You might want to provide your own version of the following files:

* `local.ini` for your custom CouchDB config

Example Dockerfile:

```
FROM apache/couchdb:latest

COPY local.ini /usr/local/etc/couchdb/local.d/
```

and then build and run

```
[sudo] docker build -t you/awesome-couchdb .
[sudo] docker run -d -p 5984:5984 -v ~/couchdb:/usr/local/var/lib/couchdb you/awesome-couchdb
```

For the `2` image, configuration is stored at `/opt/couchdb/etc/`.
