## Features

* built on top of the solid and small `debian:jessie` base image
* exposes CouchDB on port `5984` of the container
* runs everything as user `couchdb` (security ftw!)
* docker volume for data

## Run (2.0.0/latest)

Available on the docker registry as [klaemo/couchdb:latest](https://index.docker.io/u/klaemo/couchdb/).
This is a build of the CouchDB 2.0 release. A data volume
is exposed on `/opt/couchdb/data`, and the node's port is exposed on `5984`.

Please note that CouchDB no longer autocreates system tables for you, so you will
have to create `_global_changes`, `_metadata`, `_replicator` and `_users` manually (the admin interface has a "Setup" menu that does this for you).
The node will also start in [admin party mode](http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/security.html#party)!

```bash
# expose it to the world on port 5984 and use your current directory as the CouchDB Database directory
[sudo] docker run -p 5984:5984 -v $(pwd):/opt/couchdb/data klaemo/couchdb
18:54:48.780 [info] Application lager started on node nonode@nohost
18:54:48.780 [info] Application couch_log_lager started on node nonode@nohost
18:54:48.780 [info] Application couch_mrview started on node nonode@nohost
18:54:48.780 [info] Application couch_plugins started on node nonode@nohost
[...]
```

Note that you can also use the NODENAME environment variable to set the name of the CouchDB node inside the container.
Once running, you can visit the new admin interface at `http://dockerhost:5984/_utils/`

## Run (1.6.1)

Available as an official image on Docker Hub as [couchdb](https://hub.docker.com/_/couchdb/)

```bash
[sudo] docker pull couchdb:latest

# expose it to the world on port 5984
[sudo] docker run -d -p 5984:5984 --name couchdb couchdb

curl http://localhost:5984
```

...or with mounted volume for the data

```bash
# expose it to the world on port 5984 and use your current directory as the CouchDB Database directory
[sudo] docker run -d -p 5984:5984 -v $(pwd):/usr/local/var/lib/couchdb --name couchdb couchdb
```

If you want to provide your own config, you can either mount a directory at `/usr/local/etc/couchdb`
or extend the image and `COPY` your `config.ini` (see [Build you own](#build-your-own)).

If you need (or want) to run couchdb in `net=host` mode, you can customize the port and bind address using environment variables:

 - `COUCHDB_HTTP_BIND_ADDRESS` (default: `0.0.0.0`)
 - `COUCHDB_HTTP_PORT` (default: `5984`)

### with couchperuser plugin

This build includes the `couchperuser` plugin.
`couchperuser` is a CouchDB plugin daemon that creates per-user databases [github.com/etrepum/couchperuser](https://github.com/etrepum/couchperuser).

```
[sudo] docker run -d -p 5984:5984 --name couchdb couchdb:1.6.1-couchperuser
```

### In a developer cluster

Available on the docker registry as [klaemo/couchdb:dev](https://index.docker.io/u/klaemo/couchdb/).
This build demonstrates the CouchDB clustering features by creating a local
cluster of a default three nodes inside the container, with a proxy in front.
This is great for testing clustering in your local environment.

```bash
# expose the cluster to the world
[sudo] docker run -it -p 5984:5984 klaemo/couchdb:dev

[ * ] Setup environment ... ok
[ * ] Ensure CouchDB is built ... ok
[ * ] Prepare configuration files ... ok
[ * ] Start node node1 ... ok
[ * ] Start node node2 ... ok
[ * ] Start node node3 ... ok
[ * ] Check node at http://127.0.0.1:15984/ ... failed: [Errno socket error] [Errno 111] Connection refused
[ * ] Check node at http://127.0.0.1:25984/ ... ok
[ * ] Check node at http://127.0.0.1:35984/ ... ok
[ * ] Check node at http://127.0.0.1:15984/ ... ok
[ * ] Running cluster setup ... ok
[ * ] Developers cluster is set up at http://127.0.0.1:15984.

Time to hack! ...
```
**Note:** By default the cluster will be exposed on port `5984`, because it uses haproxy
(passes `--with-haproxy` to `dev/run`) internally.

...but you can pass arguments to the binary

```bash
docker run -it klaemo/couchdb:dev --admin=foo:bar
```
**Note:** This will overwrite the default `--with-haproxy` flag. The cluster **won't** be exposed on
port `5984` anymore. The individual nodes listen on `15984`, `25984`, ...`x5984`. If you wish to expose
the cluster on `5984`, pass `--with-haproxy` explicitly.

Examples:
```bash
# display the available options of the couchdb startup script
docker run --rm klaemo/couchdb:dev --help

# Enable admin party ðŸŽ‰ and expose the cluster on port 5984
docker run -it -p 5984:5984 klaemo/couchdb:dev --with-admin-party-please --with-haproxy

# Start two nodes (without proxy) exposed on port 15984 and 25984
docker run -it -p 15984:15984 -p 25984:25984 klaemo/couchdb:dev -n 2
```

## Build your own

You can use `klaemo/couchdb` as the base image for your own couchdb instance.
You might want to provide your own version of the following files:

* `local.ini` for your custom CouchDB config

Example Dockerfile:

```
FROM klaemo/couchdb:latest

COPY local.ini /usr/local/etc/couchdb/local.d/
```

and then build and run

```
[sudo] docker build -t you/awesome-couchdb .
[sudo] docker run -d -p 5984:5984 -v ~/couchdb:/usr/local/var/lib/couchdb you/awesome-couchdb
```

For the `2.0-single` image, configuration is stored at `/opt/couchdb/etc/`.
